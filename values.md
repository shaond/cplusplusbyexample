# Values

C++ has a number of “primitive types”. These include integers, floating point numbers, boolean values and characters. In addition to this, there are extensions in the Standard Template Library (STL) for strings, vectors etc.

Here are some examples of basic types:

## Integers
Integers are useful for a number of tasks such as looping (or iterating). They are unsigned by default, which means that they can have a positive or negative values.

```
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a {0}; // The {0} represents the value that a is instantiated as.
    
    int b {10};
    
    
}
```
